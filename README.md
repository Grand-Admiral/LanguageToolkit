# LanguageToolkit
The LanguageToolkit is a simple JS interactive webpage that allows easy conversions between English sound phrases and this constructed language's sound phrases. Overall this will be converting sentences from the English character set and this language's set allowing the use of a keyboard when writing in this different language instead of manual selection of characters.

<h1> SETUP: </h1>
In order for this to work you will need a device that can run the html js css files. Almost every web browser should beable to handle this.
- open the LanguageToolkit (LTK) File
- open the index.html file (this should open in a web browser if not right click on it and select "open with" edge, chrome, firefox, etc)

<h1> Run:</h1>
<p> Now you should see a few options on the page: <p>
<p>- Show results on this page:</p>
<p>- Show results on blank page:</p>

When you write in english sounding of the text in either of these boxes the translation will appear. However, blank page will open the translation in a new blank page which can be used for printing.
