# LanguageToolkit
The LanguageToolkit is a simple JS interactive webpage that allows easy conversions between English sound phrases and this constructed language's sound phrases. Overall this will be converting sentences from the English character set and this language's set allowing the use of a keyboard when writing in this different language instead of manual selection of characters.
